# Mask Detection using MobileNet_v2
This project aims to detect if a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time using the MobileNet_v2 model. The project is developed using Python and OpenCV library.

## Requirements
* OpenCV 4.5.1 or above
* TensorFlow 2.0 or above
## Installation
* Install OpenCV using pip: pip install opencv-python
* Install TensorFlow using pip: pip install tensorflow

## Model
The model used in this project is MobileNet_v2, which is a lightweight deep learning model that is optimized for mobile devices. The model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and has been fine-tuned on our mask and non-mask dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two classes: mask and non-mask. it can be fount here https://github.com/balajisrinivas/Face-Mask-Detection/tree/master/dataset
